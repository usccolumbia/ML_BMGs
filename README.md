The identification of suitable alloy compositions for the formation of bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) is a key challenge in materials science. In this study, we developed machine learning (ML) models to predict the critical casting diameter (𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥) of Fe-based BMGs, enabling rapid assessment of glass-forming ability (GFA) using composition-based and calculated thermophysical features
